            C.R.U.D, standing for Create, Read, Update, Delete, are the four
            basic functions of persistent storage. Alternate words are sometimes
            used whe defining the four basic functions of CRUD, such as
            <i>retrieve</i> instead of <b>read</b>, <i>modifiy</i> instead of
            <b>update</b>, or <i>destroy</i> instead of <b>delete</b>. CRUD is
            also sometimes used to describe user interface (UI) conventions that
            facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information often usin
            computer-based forms and reports.

          <p>
            We will be taking a look at SQL, which has different names for the
            CRUD functions, these are called <b>Statements</b>
          </p>
          <p>Below are the names:</p>

          <div id="tableContainer">
            <table id="myTable">
              <tr>
                <th>Operation</th>
                <th>SQL</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Create</td>
                <td>INSERT</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Read</td>
                <td>SELECT</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Update</td>
                <td>UPDATE</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Delete</td>
                <td>DELETE</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="article">
          <p><b>INSERT / Create</b></p>

          <p>
            In Database Systems, Insert is used for creating and therefore,
            inserting new records into the table.
          </p>

          <p>
            To insert a new record into a table you need to use the keyword
            INSERT INTO, and then specify the table name and the columns that
            you want to insert. The columns go inside of the parenthesis and
            then we specify a VALUES clause.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this example, our table is named called 'Users' and it has 2
            columns (values): email and password. This is how we insert a email
            and password into the records.
          </p>

          <div class="codeExample">
            <code>
              <pre>
INSERT INTO Users
VALUES ("john@gmail.com","password");
                            </pre
              >
            </code>
          </div>

          <p>
            The table will now be updated with that record. But what if we want
            to insert multiple records, well lets see how to do that:
          </p>

          <div class="codeExample">
            <code>
              <pre>
INSERT INTO Users
VALUES ("sam@gmail.com","password"),("steve@gmail.com","password");
                            </pre
              >
            </code>
          </div>

          <p>
            Not hard? Yup, just get the syntax right and you'll be fine. There
            are other ways to insert records using UNION etc but we will cover
            that in a later chapter.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="article">
          <p><b>SELECT / Read</b></p>

          <p>The SELECT statement retrieves data.</p>

          <p>
            To retrieve data you need to use the syntax below, its pretty
            straight forward.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let's say, with the new records we inserted earlier, we now want to
            retrieve the data and display it in front of us.
          </p>

          <div class="codeExample">
            <code>
              <pre>
SELECT * FROM Users;
                            </pre
              >
            </code>
          </div>

          <p>
            That code above would retrieve the records and displays ALL (using
            the * - called the Wildcard Character) the records in that table.
            But what if we wanted to select a specific email, like
            'sam@gmail.com' for example?
          </p>

          <div class="codeExample">
            <code>
              <pre>
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE colour = 'sam@gmail.com';
                            </pre
              >
            </code>
          </div>

          <p>
            This result will return only the record where the email column has
            'sam@gmail.com'. In this instance only the 2nd record will show.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="article">
          <p><b>UPDATE / Update</b></p>

          <p>
            Using the UPDATE statement in SQL, changes the existing records of
            the table.
          </p>

          <p>
            The best syntax for updating your records is to use the UPDATE, SET
            and WHERE keywords.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let's say earlier, we inserted the wrong password of the 3rd record
            ("steve@gmail.com","password") and actually, the password was
            actually "Password". Let's try to update the records to change that:
          </p>

          <div class="codeExample">
            <code>
              <pre>
UPDATE Users
SET password = 'Password'
WHERE email = 'steve@gmail.com';
                            </pre
              >
            </code>
          </div>

          <p>
            We can now use the SELECT statement to check and see if it has
            changed. And most likely it has :D.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="article">
          <p><b>DELETE / Delete</b></p>

          <p>
            DELETE in SQL operations refers to removing a record from table.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using DELETE, FROM and WHERE you can target the specific record(s)
            for deletion.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let's say we needed to remove a record as the user has left the
            system. The item having a unique email.
          </p>

          <div class="codeExample">
            <code>
              <pre>
DELETE FROM Users
WHERE email = 'john@gmail.com';
                            </pre
              >
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            Retrieving the results again will show that the record had been
            removed.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="article">
          <p><b>Other</b></p>

          <p>
            You also need to create the table to perform the database operations
            and you can do that like this:
          </p>

          <div class="codeExample">
            <code>
              <pre>
CREATE TABLE Users;
                            </pre
              >
            </code>
          </div>

          <p>
            As well as creating the table, if you ever need to permanently
            remove the table you need to drop the table, dropping removes the
            data as well as the table, whilst deleting does the same but it can
            be rolled back. Drop is the cleaner option if you are just
            practicing with databases.
          </p>

          <div class="codeExample">
            <code>
              <pre>
DROP TABLE Users;
                            </pre
              >
            </code>
          </div>
        </div>
